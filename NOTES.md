## Description
https://infotec2017.sched.com/event/9Obm/javascript-es6-beyond

The JavaScript language is rapidly evolving. The ES6 specification ushered in arrow functions, templates strings, destructuring, iterators, and other great additions to the language. The next version of JavaScript, ES7, will bring even more features. This workshop will begin exploring some of the exciting additions to the language as well as best practices with the features available today all while building a few fun applications. We won’t be using any frameworks or third-party libraries. Just good-old-fashion vanilla JavaScript.

Workshop Prerequisites:
- We’ll be writing a lot of JavaScript code so make sure you have your favorite code editor installed. If you need one, download Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code (http://code.visualstudio.com/).
- You’ll also need a modern web browser installed like Microsoft Edge, Chrome, or Firefox.
- Course files will be provided when you arrive at the workshop.

## Misc

Code.Visualstudio.com -- Read the docs

http://jscs.info/ has merged with ESLint

https://standardjs.com/ -- new.  Instructor's preference.  

## Official Start

CanIUse.com is a great site.   All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is covered.
There is a Resources tab that is very useful for many of the features.  
e.g. http://caniuse.com/#search=promise

## Let and Const not Var

There are no types in JavaScript.  People don't like the dynamic types.

Let is locally scoped variable.  

Script tag is supposed to go in the body, not the head.   It's good to load your main JavaScript after the rest of the webpage.

Command Option I to open developer tools on Mac.
